"""riscv_reference.py -- THE ONE SYMBOLIC SIMULATOR OF THE RISC-V MACHINE.

TASK sl1 (2026-09-14): THE TABLE IS GENERATED.  Sections 4, 4b and 5 of
this file -- the builders a person typed from Sail's text, the compressed
expansions, and the opcode table -- are gone.  `step` now hands each line
to `sail_lifter/lifter.py`: the image's assembler turns the text into its
word, the Sail model's own decoder (`encdec_backwards`, as the sail
compiler's Lean backend emitted it) turns the word into the model's own
instruction value, and the model's own `execute` (emitted the same way,
read by `sail_lifter/lean_reader.py`) applies it to this file's
MachineState.  Nothing below names an instruction.  The transcription this
replaced is kept beside it for the record, unread by anything:
`sail_lifter/riscv_reference_transcription_2026-09-13.py.txt`.  The family
constants that other files import (R_TYPE, LOAD, ...) are kept as EMPTY
containers so those imports still resolve; they describe nothing now.


Node: hq.research.arch_unit_oracle
(`PRIVATE/PseudoCoupHQ/Planning/node_0_3_research/node_0_3_2_arch_unit_oracle/CORE_0_3_2_arch_unit_oracle.md`).
Task rv1, brief `PRIVATE/PseudoCoupHQ/Research/briefs/task_rv1_brief.md`
section 3(a).

WHAT THIS FILE IS, one sentence, in relation: the riscv64 twin of
`PRIVATE/PseudoCoupHQ/Research/op_pipeline/reference.py` -- one z3
term per place an instruction writes, read off the instruction's own
disassembled text, so a carved riscv64 body can be walked into a term the
same way an x86 body is.

IT IS BUILT IN reference.py's OWN SHAPE, section for section, so the two
can be read side by side and so section 5 of the brief can count what had
to be written again:

    section 1  the widths, the sorts, and the register tables
    section 2  MachineState -- the sub-node
    section 3  the operand reader -- one place, used by every builder
    section 4  the term builders -- one per family, no second table
    section 5  opcode_table -- THE ONE TABLE
    section 6  RiscvReference -- the node's own class

THE FOUR THINGS THAT ARE NOT IN THE x86 FILE, each a fact of the
architecture and not a choice of ours:

  * THERE IS NO FLAGS REGISTER.  Nothing here writes one, nothing reads
    one, and `MachineState` has no `flags` attribute.  x86 spends
    `build_flag_only`, `carry_bit`, `overflow_bit`, `predicate_of`,
    `condition_table.py` and the whole `set`/`cmov`/`j` suffix family on
    the flags; RISC-V spends `slt`/`sltu` (a comparison writes a general
    register a 0 or a 1) and the six branches (a comparison is read
    inside the branch itself).

  * EVERY REGISTER WRITE IS THE FULL 64 BITS.  x86's `full64` /
    `place_bits` / `KEEPS_THE_UPPER_BITS` rule -- a 32-bit write
    zero-extends, an 8- or 16-bit write keeps the register's other bits --
    has no counterpart: the architecture has no sub-register names.  The
    32-bit forms (`addw`, `srliw`, `mulw` ...) compute at 32 bits and
    SIGN-EXTEND the result into the whole register, which is one rule
    written once here (`sign_extend_w`).

  * REGISTER x0 IS THE CONSTANT ZERO.  It reads zero and a write to it is
    discarded.  That is what makes the assembler's reading aids (`li`,
    `mv`, `ret`, `nop`, `seqz`) expressible with no new instructions, and
    it is why this file is walked over `llvm-objdump -M no-aliases` text:
    the aids are spellings, and a spelling is not machine form.

  * DIVISION DOES NOT TRAP.  x86's `idiv` raises on a zero divisor and on
    the MIN / -1 overflow, and the corpus's units carry a guard around it.
    RISC-V defines both: `div` by zero is all ones, `rem` by zero is the
    dividend, `divu` by zero is 2^64-1, `remu` by zero is the dividend,
    and `div`(MIN, -1) is MIN with `rem` 0.  The reference states them and
    the Sail model checks them.

THE HONEST LIMITS, named rather than hidden.

  * `simulate` walks the body in TEXT ORDER, exactly as the x86 reference
    does.  A conditional branch is recorded as a guard row and its
    condition is kept; no branch-merging walk is coded here, because the
    ten bodies of this task's handful have none.
  * `auipc` reads the program counter.  Its term carries a `pc` symbol,
    and the point check of section 3(b) cannot present a program counter
    as an input, so `auipc` is REFUSED BY NAME there rather than counted
    as agreeing.
  * The floating-point family here is exactly the instructions the ten
    carved bodies spell -- the same rule the x86 table follows ("no entry
    is invented for an opcode no body contains").  The vector extension is
    absent.
  * A floating-point instruction carries a ROUNDING MODE operand, which
    `llvm-objdump` prints as a trailing `dyn` when the instruction defers
    to the `fcsr` register.  This file reads round-to-nearest-even for
    every rounding, which is what `fcsr` holds at reset and what the ten
    bodies run under; a body that writes `fcsr` first is not modelled and
    none of the ten does.
  * ONE INSTRUCTION OUTSIDE RV64I+M IS IN THE TABLE, and it is here
    because a carved body spells it: `czero.eqz` of the Zicond extension,
    which clang 21 emits for the select the handful's `cmovne` row
    carries.  It is marked as an extension on its own entry.

THE SPELLING BAN, pasted verbatim as required:

"THE SPELLING BAN, ABSOLUTE (the owner, restated in anger 2026-08-25 after a
second violation).  No operator token may appear in ANY key, grouping,
pairing, row structure, candidate selection, or comparison scope, anywhere
in this line -- not in matching, not in "which pairs get compared", not in
report rows, not in dropdowns.  The candidate set for comparison comes from
machine-form evidence (clusters, connections, type pairs) or from ratified
intention -- never from the token.  The token appears exactly once per
unit: as a display label on the member.  HISTORY OF VIOLATIONS, so the
pattern is visible: (1) the arch campaign's cross-language matrix (caught
by the owner 2026-08-24); (2) verdicts.py's row pairing (caught by the owner
2026-08-25 -- the fix brief itself reintroduced it as "same-operator
pairs").  MECHANICAL GUARD REQUIRED: every pipeline stage that groups or
pairs units must run the spelling-key check
(op_pipeline/check_no_spelling_keys.py) and refuse its own output on
failure.  A brief handed to any subagent for this line MUST paste this
paragraph verbatim."

No operator token appears in this file.  The table is keyed by ARCH
MNEMONIC, which is machine-form evidence read off the disassembled body,
never by the source spelling a probe was generated from.

Coding discipline (the owner's ruling): no complex/compound one-liner statements.
