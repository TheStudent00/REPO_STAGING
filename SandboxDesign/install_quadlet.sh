# itself if the daemon crashes.
#
# WHAT A QUADLET IS
#   A file describing a container, placed in a directory systemd watches.
#   systemd's podman generator reads it and produces a real service unit —
#   so `systemctl --user status sandbox-runner` works, the container comes
#   back after a reboot, and Restart=on-failure applies. It replaces the
#   older `podman generate systemd` approach.
#
# This REPLACES ./up.sh and ./down.sh as the way the containers run.
# The unit files live in the repo under quadlet/ and are copied to
# ~/.config/containers/systemd/, which is the directory systemd reads.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install_quadlet.sh            install and start
#   ./install_quadlet.sh --remove   stop, disable, and remove the units

# A `.network` file becomes a oneshot service that creates the network and

# `podman network rm` while that service still reads as active, systemd
# believes the network exists, skips recreating it, and the container's
# `podman run --network sandbox-egress` fails with exit 125.
#
# So: stop the network SERVICES first, and only then remove the networks.
