# Start the sandbox: two networks, two containers.
#
# NETWORK SHAPE
#   sandbox-egress    ordinary bridge, has a route out. ONLY the proxy is on it.
#   sandbox-internal  created with --internal, which means podman installs no
#                     route out of it at all. The runner is on this one only.
#
#   So the runner's only reachable peer is sandbox-proxy:3128, and the proxy
#   refuses any hostname absent from proxy/allowlist.txt. There is no second
#   path to the internet to forget about.
#
# Usage:  ./up.sh
#
# CPU SHARE
#   sandbox-runner starts with --cpus "$SANDBOX_CPUS", DEFAULT 6 — the
#   full share this sandbox has always taken. RULED 2026-08-22 (the owner):
#   "default is full CPUs. user can throttle how they see fit."
#
#   To throttle a long run so it does not hold every core hot for hours:
#
#       SANDBOX_CPUS=3 ./up.sh
#
#   Roughly halving the cores roughly doubles a run's wall clock. This
#   is a fixed share, not a feedback loop — it does not read temperature
#   or back off dynamically. Raise or lower it by hand.
#
#   The systemd path (quadlet/sandbox-runner.container) carries the same
#   full-share default, so the two agree.

# ---- agent lane ----------------------------------------------------------
# A Cowork/Claude session can write files under <WORKSPACE_DIR> but cannot run
# podman. Binding these four directories from the host makes the hot folder
# reachable by a plain file write: the session writes agent/drop/x.sh, the
# daemon's close_write watch fires, and the session reads agent/status/x.sh.status
# and agent/out/ back. No shell on the session's side is involved.

# Configured mounts come from ./mounts.conf — one `<host>:<container>[:mode]`
# per line, default read-only. See mounts.conf.example. No project's paths are
# named in this repo: SandboxDesign is a template, and which directories a
# machine exposes is that machine's configuration.
#
# Read-only is the default because it keeps the design's core property — a run
# cannot alter the originals — while still testing against the real tree with
# no copy step. Products go to /out and the caller places them.
#
# Never mount a home directory wholesale: one multi-gigabyte tree in it will
# exhaust a caller's file descriptors and defeat the isolation besides.
